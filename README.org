#+TITLE: pi-clock

A (dangerously) simple LED clock display driver for the Raspberry Pi.

** Get started
- Install the [[http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html][bcm2835]] library.
- Clone the repo.
- Edit =pi-clock.h= to identify the GPIO pins you're using for your display's pins.
- =make && sudo ./pi-clock=

** Commentary
Not yet; there's an absurdly long blog post on this coming, just as soon as I finish revamping my blog to suck less so I can update it more than once a year. Stay tuned.

If you want to talk about it in the meanwhile, [[mailto:me@aaron-miller.me][email me]].
